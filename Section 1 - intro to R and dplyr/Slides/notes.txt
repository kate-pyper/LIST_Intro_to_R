Ideas for session:

- Start with both tasks in excel - think about steps etc (if one step is actually a big leap think about what goes into that big step)
- Collect ideas for steps to take in R for both 

- Terminology: 
	- RStudio interface, Posit/R/RStudio differences 
	- variable types (data frames, vectors, character/numeric/logical)
	- functions in general (mean, sum, basic calculations to get started with)

- first task in R
- chat around first task in R

- dplyr verbs:
	- select + associated functions (starts_with(), contains(), where(), if_any/all())
	- filter (introduce logical statements when talking about filter)
	- summarise (+ group_by())
	- mutate (+ how mutate works with grouped tables?)
	- across

- second task in R
- chat around second task in R

- Introduce joins: common types of actual joins, filtering joins

- third task in R
- Chat around third task in R
- Homework (similar to intro to R - maybe more prescriptive? Thoughts?)

Tasks (KP: think these need work - need to look through more of the data sets...):
Delayed Discharge Data

- Task 1: Read in data, calculate a couple of column summaries, maybe extract some rows?
- Task 2: Filter out a specific council area and calculate the total number of delayed bed days within each age group for any reason
- Task 3: Filter out all council areas relating to your health board. Calculate the number of delayed bed days per bed. Within each age group which has the highest?
