# `R`, RStudio and Posit

---

## Why `R`?

`R` is a programming language designed around statistical analysis. 

--

### Advantages:

- Shareable
- Flexible
- Open Source
- Massive community

--

### Disadvantages:

- Programming is hard

---

## RStudio and Posit

`R` is what does the heavy lifting - think of it as the engine.

RStudio/Posit are the wrappers that allow us to interact with `R` - like the controls of a car.

RStudio and Posit are one and the same, in that Posit used to be called RStudio. At PHS we use a server based version of Posit called [Posit workbench](https://pwb.publichealthscotland.org/auth-sign-in).

## Programming

Since `R` is a programming language, it's important to think about tasks from a programming perspective.

The key in this is breaking tasks down into small chunks of what needs to be done. 

Since you are familiar with doing analysis in other software (and to ease you in) we'll start by completing the tasks set out in Excel.

While you are doing this, make a note of the steps you are carrying out while you are doing the analysis.
