## This Session

In this section, we'll start by introducing projects in R and why you should use them. Then we'll move on to plotting:

- Introducing `{ggplot2}`
- Basic plot types
- Adding Layers
- Themes and Styling
- Combining plots using `{patchwork}`

# Projects

## Why use projects?

When reading in data previously we have specified the full file path to the file that we want to read in. These are *absolute* file paths.

If we have an information request folder where we have some R scripts and some data that we are using to complete the request and someone decides to rename the main folder, or move the folder somewhere else, that means we would have to edit every script where files are read in or saved out to ensure we are picking up the right file.

Projects overcome this by setting a *relative* path. The working directory is set to whatever folder the project file is saved in - so folders above the project can be renamed or moved without affecting your script.

Using projects also allows you to use github for version control and collaboration - which we'll come to in due course!

## Starting a new project

To start a new project click on the symbol that looks like the letter `R` in a box that is in the second row of the menu bar and second from the left. This will open a window:

## Starting a new project

If you haven't got a folder set up to save your analysis in select the first option "New Directory". This will let you create a new folder.

If you have already set up a folder to work from and want to associate it with a project select "Existing Directory". this will allow you to navigate to the relevant folder.

If you are taking a project from github select the third option "Version Control". This will ask you to link to the repository and create a folder to save your analysis in.

## Opening an existing project

There are many ways to open an existing project in RStudio and all of these are available in Posit, however some methods of opening projects are more robust in Posit than others. 

[The recommended way of opening projects in Posit](https://public-health-scotland.github.io/knowledge-base/docs/Posit%20Infrastructure?doc=FAQs.md#projects) is:

1. Open a small session with 0.2 CPUs and 200MB memory

2. Click the "New Session" button in the top left of the interface (be careful it's right next to the quit button!)

3. In the window that opens select the "Project" tab and navigate to the project file

4. Input memory requirements and then click open session

# {ggplot2}

## The Grammar of Graphics

`ggplot2` is based on a grammar of graphics, which is really just a way of thinking about building plots up from scratch. It is made up of several layers, some of which you'll interact with more than others:

1. Data

2. Mapping

3. Statistics

4. Scales

5. Geometries

6. Facets

7. Coordinates

8. Theme

The main topics that we need to be concerned about to start building plots are *Data*, *Mapping* and *Geometries*.

---

## Data

To start building your plot you have to specify what data that you are using. You can do this directly in the function `ggplot()` which initiates your plot:

```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(my_data)
```

Your data should be in the right format for plotting. Usually this means tidy format (each observation has its own row & each variable has its own column).

---

## Mapping

Mapping describes how the variables in your data correspond to features on your plot - e.g which variable goes on the x axis, which variable describes the colour of the points in your scatter plot.

These are also called *aesthetics* and are defined within the `aes()` function. Each type of plot will have specific aesthetics that need to be mapped (e.g. a scatterplot will need `x` and `y`) These can be found in help files associated with each plot type.

Where you put your mapping specification will depend on what you're plotting. 

In general it will be appropriate to specify a global mapping within `ggplot()` alongside your data. This applies the same aesthetic mapping to each layer that you're plotting - e.g. you might want a line plot which also has the points on it - these would both share the same mapping

If you're doing something that requires different data to be plotted on different layers then you can also specify your mapping within the individual geometry function. 

---

## Geometries

Geometries are what defines the plot type. These are all functions which take the form `geom_x()` where `x` denotes what it is that you are trying to plot. Some common plot types and their geometries are:

- scatter plot: `geom_point()`
- box plot: `geom_boxplot()`
- line plot: `geom_line()`
- bar chart: `geom_bar()` or `geom_col()`
- histogram: `geom_histogram()`

We combine plotting components with a `+`, so that plotting a histogram of the variable `var` within a data frame called `my_data` would look like:

```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(my_data, aes(x = var)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

Specifying `aes()` within `geom_histogram()` is also appropriate:

```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(my_data) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = var))
```
---

## Putting it all together

### Load packages and read in data

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# All of these are from tidyverse so I'd consider loading tidyverse as a whole
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(lubridate)

# Project is open in the intro to R training folder so don't have to specify full path!
waiting_times <- read_csv("Section 2 - projects and plotting/Data/Waiting times.csv")
```
```{r, include = FALSE}
# All of these are from tidyverse so I'd consider loading tidyverse as a whole
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(lubridate)

# Project is open in the intro to R training folder so don't have to specify full path!
waiting_times <- read_csv("/conf/LIST_analytics/West Hub/03 - Training/Posit Training Cross Team/Introduction to R/Section 2 - projects and plotting/Data/Waiting times.csv")
```

## Putting it all together

### Line and point chart - within 4 hour target by Week

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 4}

waiting_times %>% 
  mutate(WeekEndingDate = ymd(WeekEndingDate)) %>% 
  group_by(WeekEndingDate) %>%
  summarise(within = sum(NumberWithin4HoursEpisode),
            percent = 100*within/sum(NumberOfAttendancesEpisode)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = WeekEndingDate, y = percent)) + 
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()
             
```

---
## Putting it all together

### Bar chart - Average % meeting target by health board

```{r, fig.width = 14, fig.height = 4}

waiting_times %>% 
  group_by(HBT) %>%
  summarise(PercentageWithin4HoursEpisode = mean(PercentageWithin4HoursEpisode)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = HBT, x = PercentageWithin4HoursEpisode, fill = PercentageWithin4HoursEpisode > 85)) + 
  geom_col()
             
```
